# Simple-Movie-DB

# What does this application do?

This application is a simple movie database that loads a list of movies from a text file (files/DatabaseInfo.txt). It then allows the user to search for a movie by title or rating. It also allows the user to add a new movie or see the whole list of movies available in the database. **The GUI is entirely in Swedish!**.

# How do I run this application?
1. Run `javac -encoding ISO-8859-1 Launcher.java` from a terminal window.
2. Now run `java Launcher`. Note that Launcher is case sensitive.
